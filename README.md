# JS for everyone

## 🏃‍♂️ Simple start

1. **`npm install`** at the root
2. **`npm run dev`** at the root
3. open **`http://localhost:9000/`**


## 💡 PS

The project has a [Git Hooks](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-hooks), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) set up, to validate your JS code.

## 💡 PPS

Please, make sure there are no linter errors in your homework!

## 🤞 Good luck
